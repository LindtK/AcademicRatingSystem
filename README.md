# AcademicRatingSystem
system that automates the process of rating academic records.

The system is intended to works as follows:

if a learner is a first year of that year, then we create a new record for the student.
-> capture their details and marks and generate an academic record from that and indicate whether they advance to second year or not based on academic progession rules.

else if the learner is not a first time entering student but still not in final , this means that they have an academic history with the institution already and we now capture marks for current academic year for modules registered and we study the already existing academic record to determine if they advance to final year or not.

else if the learner is in final year, we study the already existing academic record and capture student marks and determine if the student is graduating or not.
